# Senior DevOps Engineer Tech Test (GitHub + Jenkins + AWS)

Welcome! This tech test is designed to simulate real-world tasks you'd
face at Cartrawler. We use GitHub, Jenkins, and AWS (especially EKS and ECR) for our DevOps stack.

---
## Your Mission
Build and deploy a simple microservice using Jenkins and Kubernetes on
AWS. Follow the instructions below and feel free to enhance wherever you see fit!

---
### Part 1: Kubernetes Setup

- Use the provided app or create your own (keep it simple)
- Define the following K8s manifests in `/k8s`:
    - `deployment.yaml`
    - `service.yaml`
    - `ingress.yaml`
    - `configmap.yaml`/ `secret.yaml`
    - Package with Helm library chart in `/helm-chart`

### Part 2: Jenkins Pipeline
- Create a `Jenkinsfile` that does:
    1. Checkout
    2. Lint YAML/K8s (e.g., kubeval/yamllint)
    3. Run mocked unit tests
    4. Build and push Docker image to Amazon ECR
    5. Deploy the k8s resources to EKS in jenkins namespace
    6. Notify via Slack/email
    7. Optional: rollback on deploy failure

- Include separate pipelines or stages for `staging` and `production`

> **Note:** If you do not have access to ECR or EKS, you may:
>   - Comment out the related steps in the Jenkinsfile
>   - Add `echo` statements or `sleep` to simulate those stages
>   - Clearly document what would happen at each step


### Part 3: AWS
# **Note:** If you do not have access to a live AWS environment (EKS/ECR), that's completely fine.
#
# - Please document how you would structure and implement these steps, assuming full access.
# - You may use mock values or simulate with tools like `minikube`, `kind`, or Docker locally.
# - The goal is to see your DevOps thinking and approach — infrastructure doesn't need to be live.

- Use AWS CLI to interact with ECR and EKS (can be commented/mocked if no access)
- Document IAM roles/permissions required
- Bonus: suggest or include infra-as-code (e.g., Terraform/CDK) for EKS cluster

### Part 4: Documentation
Document your solution in the `docs/archtiecture.md` file:

    - Considerations in your approach
    - How you would implement the solution in an existing organisation
    - Additional things you would consider for long term maintenance

---
##  Submission
    - Push your code to a public GitHub repo or share a ZIP file
    - Include a short `README` with setup steps
    - Make sure everything is runnable and well-commented

---
Good luck, and we’re excited to see what you come up with!
